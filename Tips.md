Whether to omit variables or not depends on the specific goals and requirements of the analysis, as well as the characteristics of the data. In general, it is not advisable to omit variables arbitrarily without a clear justification, as this can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.

Instead, it is important to carefully consider the theoretical and empirical relationships between the variables and the dependent variable, as well as potential confounding factors, multicollinearity, and other issues. In some cases, it may be necessary to transform or combine variables to better capture their effects, or to use advanced statistical techniques such as ridge regression, principal component analysis, or factor analysis.

Ultimately, the decision to omit variables should be based on a rigorous analysis of the data and the research question, and should be well-justified and transparent. It is also important to evaluate the robustness of the results to different specifications and model assumptions, and to interpret the coefficients and significance tests in the context of the broader research literature and empirical evidence.
