 Looking at the results of the OLS model, we can see the estimated coefficients (beta values) for each of the independent variables. The constant term is 26.15.

From the coefficients, we can see that UNEMPC (unemployment rate) has a positive coefficient of 0.57, which suggests that there is a positive relationship between inflation (CPICANALL) and the unemployment rate. Similarly, CEIR (Consumer Expectations Index) has a positive coefficient of 0.14, indicating that there is a positive relationship between inflation and consumer expectations.

On the other hand, we can see that CBR (Bank of Canada's policy interest rate) has a negative coefficient of -1.35, implying that there is an inverse relationship between inflation and the policy interest rate. CIR (inflation expectations implied by bond yields) has a positive coefficient of 0.03, suggesting that there is a positive relationship between inflation and inflation expectations.

The coefficients for the other independent variables (MSC, RGDP, TSX, IRGDP, SRGDP) are relatively small compared to the other variables. Therefore, they may not have a significant impact on inflation.

Based on these results, we can conclude that the unemployment rate, consumer expectations, policy interest rate, and inflation expectations are important factors to consider when predicting inflation. However, we should keep in mind that these results are based on a specific dataset and should be interpreted accordingly.
